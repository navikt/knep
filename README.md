# Knada NetworkPolicy Controller - knetpoller
Simple k8s controller responsible for adding correct egress rules for KNADA airflow worker tasks. The controller will watch for pods created with the labels `component: worker` and `release: airflow` and create a networkpolicy whitelisting egress traffic to the hosts included in the `allowlist` annotation of the pod resource. After pod termination (either successful or errorneous) the controller will clean up and delete the previously created network policy.
